Git is an amazing tool. Without Git, collaborative development would be very different and far more chaotic. As a long-time user and even longer learner, I'm always impressed at how many hidden gems there still are.

In this dive into the world of version control, I'll look at a two Git commands; `difftool` and `mergetool`. The former aims to bring better comparison of the changes either yourself or your collaborators have made. The latter aims to help in resolving conflicts which occur due to changes made by the aforementioned parties. With these two commands being so well related, it would be unfair to give one airtime without the other.

## But first, Vim.
As an un-ashamed Vim lover (more commonly known as a _Vim lover_), this post will use Vim as the editor for these commands. If you're not familiar with Vim, then I absolutely recommend you head over to [vim-adventures.com](https://vim-adventures.com/) after reading this. Vim is a powerful and highly customisable editor with everything you need without leaving your terminal.

You don't have to know or love Vim to follow this, but I will dive in to some specifics. Feel free to use this information to set a different tool of your choice, such as [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) or just classic [diff](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/diff.1.html).

Disclaimer: I take no responsibility for you becoming trapped in Vim. In an emergency, break glass and head over to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/) to join the now 2.1 million people in the same situation. Alternatively, you can type `esc` followed by `:qa!`. The `esc` exits your current vim mode and then gives the command to `(q)uit (a)ll` with some added `!` for force.

## difftool

Depending on your team, workflow and many other factors, you may or may not run into many conflicts. You will, however, most definitely be changing things and generating diffs. Here's what the manpage says about  `git difftool`.

> git difftool is a Git command that allows you to compare and edit files between revisions using common diff tools. git difftool is a frontend to git diff and accepts the same options and arguments.

When you run `git diff` you'll see a pretty simple output with the changes shown as a unified diff straight into stdout.

```bash
diff --git a/fhrs/establishments_test.go b/fhrs/establishments_test.go
index 2e064f9..70fa151 100644
--- a/fhrs/establishments_test.go
+++ b/fhrs/establishments_test.go
@@ -232,7 +232,7 @@ func TestGetByID_Headers(t *testing.T) {
                io.WriteString(w, body)
        })

-       if err := client.SetLanguage(Cymraeg); err != nil {
+       if err := client.SetLanguage(LanguageCymraeg); err != nil {
                t.Error(err)
        }
```

 For simple changes like this, there's little to worry about, but for more complex changes this gets pretty unwieldy. It gets more complex still if you want to search it and go beyond just a quick compare and stare. Try running the following on a repo with some changes.

```bash
git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
git difftool
```

You'll notice your output now appears in a vim window with a nice side-by-side diff and all available searching and navigation goodness the editor provides.

### How do I remove or change my difftool?

I prefer to edit my `~/.gitconfig` file directly and simply add and remove lines, but you can also run `git config --global --unset diff.tool` to remove it or re-run the above with something else to change it.

### Further configuration

To make things easier, I like to add an [alias](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) so I can run my difftool every time instead of `git diff`. I also found the confirmation pretty irritating, so I also turned that off. Below are the entries in my `.gitconfig`.

```bash
[alias]
  df = difftool
[difftool]
  prompt = false
```

For Vim, you can customise the colorscheme used for diffs, if yours isn't very readable or visually pleasing. Here's an example `.vimrc`.


```bash
if &diff
    colorscheme evening
else
    colorscheme morning
endif
```

## mergetool

Let's head to the manpage again and see what we can find for `git mergetool`.

> Use git mergetool to run one of several merge utilities to resolve merge conflicts. It is typically run after git merge.

### How do conflicts occur?

A common scenario for a merge conflict usually plays out as follows:

1. There is a common development branch, let's call it `develop`.
2. You branch off of develop to implement a feature on `feature/2`. Your teammate is working on `feature/1`, independently of you.
3. Your teammate finished their feature and it was merged into `develop`.
4. You finish your feature. At this point you may either merge `develop` into `feature/2` to get your branch up to date ready for a Pull Request, or you'll simply merge `feature/2` into `develop`.
5. CONFLICT. Both of you have changed the same file and now we're left with three states to choose from and work with: your last version of `develop`, the newly updated `develop` and your changes on `feature/2`.



```bash
git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
git mergetool
```
